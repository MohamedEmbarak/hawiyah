# Changelog

All seven `@hawiyah/*` packages share one version. Versions below 1.0 may change
APIs in a minor release; read the notes before upgrading.

## Unreleased

- The guide header links to GitHub with the DGA set's `github` icon instead of
  the word GitHub and an external-link mark.
- The release script reports when every package was already on npm instead of
  claiming it published them.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-11-10

### Icons follow the DGA Platforms Code icon library

Every interface icon now comes from Hugeicons Stroke Rounded at the pinned
commit already recorded in `packages/styles/src/assets/icons/provenance.json`,
the set used by the DGA Platforms Code icon library. Files are shipped
unchanged and colored through CSS masks; the two native select arrows keep the
upstream geometry with a fixed text color, as recorded under `derived`.

- Close and remove buttons in every adapter render a `cancel-01` icon element
  instead of a `×` character. Tree toggles use `add-01` / `minus-sign`,
  calendar navigation uses `arrow-left-01` / `arrow-right-01` (mirrored in
  RTL), sortable table headers use `arrow-up-02`, `arrow-down-02` and
  `arrow-data-transfer-vertical`, and external footer links use
  `link-square-02`.
- Stylesheet glyphs became icon masks: accordion and collapsible indicators,
  checkbox ticks, the date-picker information trigger, carousel arrows, table
  sort indicators, external links, pagination arrows and notification icons.
  Completed and error stepper markers are now solid circles with the DGA tick
  or exclamation cut out.
- Where a component's CSS already draws a close icon, it is skipped when the
  button contains its own `.hw-icon`, so markup written for 0.2.0 still shows
  exactly one icon.
- The rating keeps its star glyph: the DGA reference CSS draws stars as a glyph
  with a fractional fill, which the outline-only icon set cannot reproduce.

### Fixes

- The official-site verification toggle uses the DGA link color
  (`--hw-color-link`), raising its contrast on the muted banner from 4.31:1 to
  6.0:1 in light mode.
- Private custom properties that kept the old prefix (`--_nq-*`) are renamed
  `--_hw-*`.
- Guide tab titles use the page name. The overview and layout studio titles were
  built from their two-line headings and ran words together.
- The guide search shortcut hint stays at the inline end of the field in Arabic.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-11-09

First npm release of `@hawiyah/tokens`, `@hawiyah/styles`, `@hawiyah/core`,
`@hawiyah/vanilla`, `@hawiyah/react`, `@hawiyah/vue`, and `@hawiyah/angular`.

- Packages install from npm: `npm install @hawiyah/styles @hawiyah/<adapter>`.
- Internal `@hawiyah/*` dependencies are pinned to the exact matching version.
- `pnpm release:packages` builds, verifies, and publishes the checked tarballs;
  source manifests stay `private: true`. Pushing a `v*` tag publishes through
  GitHub Actions with npm provenance.
- The guide's install commands and downloaded example projects use the
  published packages instead of local tarballs.

### Renamed from Nasaq to Hawiyah

The project was developed as Nasaq (نسق) through 0.1 and is renamed Hawiyah
(هوية) in this release; the `@nasaq` npm scope belongs to another publisher.
The source moved from `MohamedEmbarak/nasaq` to `MohamedEmbarak/hawiyah`.
Code written against the 0.1 source needs these renames:

| 0.1 (Nasaq) | 0.2 (Hawiyah) |
| --- | --- |
| `@nasaq/*` packages | `@hawiyah/*` |
| `.nq-*` classes | `.hw-*` |
| `--nq-*` custom properties | `--hw-*` |
| `data-nq`, `data-nq-*` attributes | `data-hw`, `data-hw-*` |
| `nq:change` and other `nq:` events | `hw:change`, `hw:` |
| Angular `Nq*Component`, `Nq*Directive`, `nq-*` selectors, `nq*` directive attributes | `Hw*`, `hw-*`, `hw*` |
| Theme `nasaq` (Woven Rhythm palette) | Theme `hawiyah` (Signature palette) |
| `nasaq-*` brand assets and loaders | `hawiyah-*` |

The logo is now the Arabic word هوية in outlined Aref Ruqaa Bold, colored with
DGA Platforms Code variables, and the handwriting loader writes the new word.
Hawiyah is described as a UI component library built to comply with the DGA
Platforms Code; compliance evidence and open items remain documented in the
alignment and validation records.
